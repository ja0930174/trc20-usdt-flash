# Flash USDT

Flash USDT is a cutting-edge, time-sensitive digital asset that operates just like standard USDT. It appears in wallets, can be transferred, swapped, and traded, but with a significant distinction:

**Auto-Expiration**: Flash USDT is designed to exist in your wallet for a predetermined duration, ranging from 60 to 365 days, after which it automatically vanishes without leaving any trace.

## What is Flash USDT?

Flash USDT is a unique solution tailored for vendors, P2P traders, developers, and cryptocurrency investors who require temporary liquidity that mimics real USDT. Once integrated into a wallet using the Flash USDT Software, it:

- Appears instantly (within 1â€“3 seconds)
- Functions seamlessly across wallets, DApps, P2P platforms, and DeFi protocols
- Automatically disappears after the specified flash duration (60â€“365 days)

It behaves just like traditional USDT, making it perfect for:

- OTC transactions
- Proof of funds for escrow
- Investor wallet demonstrations
- Smart contract testing
- DAO treasury simulations

## Key Features of Flash USDT

- **Instant Wallet Reflection**: USDT appears in your wallet within seconds
- **TRC-20 & ERC-20 Compatibility**: Works with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, TronLink, SafePal, and more
- **Swappable & Transferable**: Functions like native USDT on most supported platforms
- **Timed Visibility**: Active for 60 to 365 days based on your configuration
- **Bot-Detectable**: Recognized as real USDT by wallet APIs and platforms
- **Hash-Logged**: Each flash includes a unique blockchain reference hash

## How It Works

Flash USDT operates on a dual-engine protocol: **FLACH USDT + USDT FLACH**. Once activated through the Flash USDT Software, the USDT balance is injected into the selected wallet instantly.

- No bridges required
- No confirmations needed
- No gas fees incurred
- Immediate balance visibility

The USDT behaves as if it were real and remains accessible until it expires based on your selected timeframe.
